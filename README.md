# 🏦 Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant features. The model is trained using the Loan Prediction dataset and employs a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for binary classification.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Loan Prediction Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)
- **Features**: Applicant income, credit history, loan amount, dependents, education, etc.
- **Target**: Loan Status (`Y` = Approved, `N` = Not Approved)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- SVM Classifier

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Import necessary libraries and load the dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Handle missing values and encode categorical variables  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train an SVM classifier  
6. Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics  
7. Build a prediction system for new inputs

## ✅ Results

- **Model**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Accuracy**: Varies depending on train-test split (~80–85%)  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy score
